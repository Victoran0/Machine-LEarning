# python can perform element wise arithmetics

# lets add 2 to every element
# print(a + 2)

# lets substract from every element in a
# print(a - 2)

# Let multiply by 2 every element in a
# print(a * 2)

# lets divide every element in a by 2
# print(a / 2)

# lets square all ele in a
# print(a**2)

# get the sin of all the values in a
# print(np.sin(a))

# get the cosine of all the values in a
print(np.cos(a))

# we can also add up 2 numpy arrays
b = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0])

# print(a + b)
